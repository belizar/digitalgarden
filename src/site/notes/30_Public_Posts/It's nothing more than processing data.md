Recently, I starting diving into Data Engineering to better understand how handling data adds value to a business. It's a fascinating field. They divide the data lifecycle in stages like a processing pipeline: data enters in the system, gets stored somewhere useful, is transformed and finally served to stakeholders to help them make better decisions. 

It feels a lot like building an API with layers, doesn't it? We can sketch the end-to-end process of a user filling out a form: from the moment they hit "submit", until it's stored in the database, transformed, and visualized in different shapes to drive decisions.

But it goes beyond code. It's also just like designing a business process involving people (the "analog" real world). Tech companies often have non-tech teams with their own manual workflows that they want to automate.

We can apply exactly the same engineering mindset to guid non-tech people in refining their processes. Especially in today's world -- with AI, LLMs, and tools like n8n or Make -- the barrier to automation is lower than ever.

At its core, it is nothing more than processing data: moving information from Point A, shaping it into what we need, and delivering it to Point B to execute an action.

> Whether it's a Kafka topic, a REST API controller, or a human reviewing a spreadsheet, systematically, they are all just nodes and queues. The architecture remains the same; only the latency and throughput constraints change.
