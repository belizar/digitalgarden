# Building Evolutionary Thoughts


Welcome. You have landed in my **Digital Garden**.

This is not a traditional blog. You won't find SEO-optimized articles or perfect tutorials here. Instead, this is a collection of **living notes** - a public documentation of how I connect the dots between disparate worlds.

### The Philosophy
I believe that software architecture, much like thinking, is not static. It evolves.

The name **"Evolutionary Thoughts"** is a nod to the concept of *Evolutionary Architectures*: systems designed to adapt to change. I applied the same principle to my knowledge. I am obsessed with **Systems Thinking**-finding the underlying patterns that connect software, mathematics, business processes, and even physical performance.

What you see here is my current best understanding of the world, subject to refactoring as I learn more.

### Who am I?
I am Benjamin, a Software Architect based in Córdoba, Argentina, currently building systems at an early-stage startup. My work involves turning chaotic business requirements into resilient technical structures.

### Current Explorations
While my interests shift as I discover new patterns, right now I am deep-diving into:

* **Data Engineering:** Understanding data as a business enabler and a flow.
* **System Dynamics:** Applying Control Theory and Queuing Theory to software capacity planning.
* **The Met-Game:** Optimizing workflows, Developer Experience (DX), and "Learning in Public."

### How to navigate
There is no chronological feed. Thread this space like a wiki. Click on the internal links to follow a train of thought, or just explore the graph.

We are building here. Pardon the dust.
